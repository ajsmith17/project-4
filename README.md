# README

# Technology

We used Ruby on Rails, React, JavaScript, JSX, and CSS to build this app. We used Trello to keep track of what was completed and what still needed to be completed.

# Approach

We built out the backend first and used Postman to test all of the SQL routes. Second, we built out the front end with REACT. We did all CSS styling last.

# User Story

On Connectr, the user should come into the site on the home page and see all of their contacts and connections displayed. The user can click "Add Contact" in the top left corner to be taken to a form where they can add a new contact's name, email, phone number, address, and company, as well as a photo of the person if they have one (if not and the photo field is left blank, a default photo will be provided). Upon returning to the home page, the user will see the new contact sorted into alphabetical order by last name. The user can click on any one of the contacts to view all of that contact's information on a show page, and within that page will have the option to edit or delete that contact.

# Notes/Things to Add

With more time to flesh out the app, we would've added a search bar on the home page to filter through contacts as you add more, making it harder to just immediately find the right one. We probably also would've added an option for the user  to select a specific filter, like company for instance, rather than just hard-setting the filter to last name. The biggest thing however would have been adding authentication to the site.
